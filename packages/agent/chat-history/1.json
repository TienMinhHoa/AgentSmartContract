      "system": "In order to swap 0.0001 WETH to USDC, I first attempted to find the addresses for both the WETH and USDC tokens. However, I encountered an issue in locating these addresses. Without the token addresses, I am unable to perform the swap.\n\nPlease provide the contract addresses for WETH and USDC, or verify that the symbols entered are correct. Once I have the correct addresses, I can proceed with the token swap transaction."
